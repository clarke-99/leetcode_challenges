## Challenge 1544: Make The String Great

**Problem:**
Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase and uppercase English letters, a "good" string is one where no two adjacent characters are the same letter with different cases (i.e., 'a' and 'A', 'b' and 'B', etc.). You need to repeatedly remove such adjacent bad pairs until the string becomes good.

Return the resulting string after making it good. The answer is guaranteed to be unique under the given constraints. An empty string is considered good.

## Examples:

 **Example 1:**
 
 - **Input:** `s = "leEeetcode"`
 - **Output:** `"leetcode"`
 - **Explanation:** By removing adjacent bad pairs, `"leEeetcode"` is reduced to `"leetcode"`.

 **Example 2:**
 
 - **Input:** `s = "abBAcC"`
 - **Output:** `""`
 - **Explanation:** Removing adjacent bad pairs in multiple ways (e.g., `"abBAcC"` -> `"aAcC"` -> `"cC"` -> `""`) eventually results in an empty string.

 **Example 3:**
 
 - **Input:** `s = "s"`
 - **Output:** `"s"`
 - **Explanation:** Since `"s"` does not contain any adjacent bad pairs, the string remains `"s"`.

## Constraints:

- 1 <= `s.length` <= 100
- `s` contains only lowercase and uppercase English letters.
