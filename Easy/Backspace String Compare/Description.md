**Challenge 844: Backspace String Compare**

**Problem:**
Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are equal when processed by a backspace character `#`. The backspace character removes the character immediately before it. Both strings are processed to simulate typing into an empty text editor.

**Examples:**

1. **Input:** `s = "ab#c"`, `t = "ad#c"`  
   **Output:** `true`  
   **Explanation:** Both strings become `"ac"` after applying backspaces.

2. **Input:** `s = "ab##"`, `t = "c#d#"`  
   **Output:** `true`  
   **Explanation:** Both strings become `""` after applying backspaces.

3. **Input:** `s = "a#c"`, `t = "b"`  
   **Output:** `false`  
   **Explanation:** `s` becomes `"c"` while `t` remains `"b"`.

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= `s.length`, `t.length` <= 200
- `s` and `t` only contain lowercase letters and `#` characters.
