**Challenge 234: Palindrome Linked List**

**Problem:**
Given the head of a singly linked list, determine if the list is a palindrome. A linked list is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

**Examples:**

1. **Input:** `head = [1,2,2,1]`  
   **Output:** `true`  
   **Explanation:** The linked list reads the same forwards and backwards.

2. **Input:** `head = [1,2]`  
   **Output:** `false`  
   **Explanation:** The linked list does not read the same forwards and backwards.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100,000].
- Node values are in the range 0 to 9.
